# Probabilistic Resolution of Non-linear PDE

The objective of this project was to adopt a probabilistic approach for the resolution of Dirichlet Problem using It√¥ formula, Monte Carlo approximation and discretisation of The Brownian Motion. 
We then applied all of the previous to:
- Tube model in a square conductor
- Cylindrical conductor
