# Probabilistic Resolution of Non-linear PDE

The objective of this problem was to use a probabilistic approach for the resolution of Dirichlet Problem using It√¥ formula, Monte Carlo approximation and discretisation of The brownian motion. 
We then applied all of the previous theory to :
- Tube model in a square conductor
- Cylindrical conductor
